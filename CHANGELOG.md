## [1.5.1] - 2022-11-05

### Added

- Hot paths for strings

## [1.5.0] - 2022-11-05

### Added

- Added the `scoped` keyword to simplify code and allow more scenarios for the user

### Fixed

- `Grow` allowed values, which would truncate the internally represented string

## [1.3.0] - 2022-07-25

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where memory is not returned to the ArrayPool
- Fixed an issue where memory could be overwritten, giving the chance to tamper with the internal array

## [1.2.0] - 2022-04-20

### Added

- `ValueStringBuilder` constructor can take initial buffer instead of creating it itself.
- More compiler hints for inlining.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-04-16

### Added

- `Contains` method.

### Fixed

- Smaller tweaks in CI/CD
- `IndexOf` and `LastIndexOf` did not return 0 when passing an empty string. Now it is aligned to `string.IndexOf`.

### Removed

- Debug symbol package (snupkg) due to the many constraints of NuGet.org

## [1.0.1] - 2022-04-13

### Added

- Enabled some optimization hints for the compiler.
- Include debug symbols when publishing to NuGet for easier debugging experience

## [1.0.0] - 2022-04-12

### Added

- `LastIndexOf` to find the last occurence in the represented string.
- `ReplaceGeneric<T>` added for generic replacement in the string builder. Can have performance / allocation penalties in comparison to the non-generic version.

## [0.9.5] - 2022-04-10

### Added

- `IndexOf` methods to retrieve the index of the first occurence of a word.
- `Capacity` to give the user an indication if the internal array will grow soon.
- `EnsureCapacity` to set the buffer size to avoid re-allocation in a hot path.

### Fixed

- Some methods throw the wrong exception. When an index is "invalid" then a `ArgumentOutOfRange` exception is thrown.

## [0.9.4] - 2022-04-09

### Added

- Added `AppendJoin` methods.

## [0.9.3] - 2022-04-09

### Added

- Added `Replace` methods which also tries to have the least amount of allocations.
- Added `GetPinnableReference` which allows to get the content via the `fixed` keyword.

## [0.9.2] - 2022-04-06

### Added

- Added `Remove` and `Insert` methods.

## [0.9.1] - 2022-04-06

This release brings extensions to the `ValueStringBuilder` API. For `v1.0` the `ValueStringBuilder` tries to be en par with the`System.Text.StringBuilder`.

### Added

- Added extension method for `System.Text.StringBuilder` to transform into `ValueStringBuilder` without additional allocation and the other way around.
- Added `Length` readonly property which gives the length of the represented length. Added `Clear` to set the `ValueStringBuilder` to the initial point.

## [0.9.0] - 2022-04-04
